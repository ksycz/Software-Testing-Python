## Overview

Here you can find my testing projects created with Python 3.6 and the unittest testing framework. Tests were created in different time so the can differ when it comes to their complexity and testing approach as I am still improving my testing skills.

I run all tests in the latest version of Google Chrome - 65.0.3325.181 (Official Build) (64-bit).

## Environment Setup

   1. Install [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   2. Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) for package installation
    
## Run tests

   Type python3.6 and the name of the file in the terminal.
   
Enjoy!
